![Rubiks Cube](https://www.rubiks.com/images/carousel/solve-it-rubiks-cube.png)


##What is this?
- A C++ program to solve a rubiks cube
- Written to teach myself OpenCV (the solver takes a Rubiks cube face image to start off) 

##Can anyone use it?
- Yes, but it's not finished yet

###When will it be finished? 
- When I have a lot of time i.e. over mid-term break

##Can anyone steal this? 
- Yes, there will be a license on this once I find my MIT generator.

##How am I solving the cube? 
- I am still thinking about this, my current plan is a A* Iteritive Deepening function with tiles-out-of-place as the heuristic. 

##Can I actually do a rubiks cube? 
- No, I've never owned one.
